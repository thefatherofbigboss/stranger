We host meetups, treks, cultural activities, and social gatherings where strangers meet and genuine friendships form. Simply browse our events, register for ones that interest you, and show up – we handle the introductions and ice-breakers."

                    a: "Stranger Mingle is not free, but it's not expensive either. We charge reasonable fees (typically ₹299-₹599 per event) purely to maintain the platform, book venues, and run activities smoothly. This is not for profit – it's to ensure quality experiences and sustainable operations. The fees cover venue bookings, organizer support, safety measures, and platform maintenance."

                    a: "People who've just moved to a new city, students who've lost touch with college friends, IT professionals, anyone who wants to make friends but doesn't know where to start. What binds our community isn't job titles or backgrounds – it's the courage to show up and the desire for genuine friendships."

                    a: "Friendships take time. Don't be discouraged if the first event doesn't result in instant connections. Try different types of events, attend regularly, and give yourself a few opportunities. Some people click immediately, others take 3-4 events to find their circle. Keep showing up."
